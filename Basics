git init

Nice! After git init, your directory is now a Git repo — but it’s empty. So here’s the typical next steps:

⸻

✅ 1. Add a file to track

Let’s say you create a simple file:

echo "# My Project" > README.md



III - Create an empty repo on GitHub

        •       Go to GitHub
        •       Click “New” repository
        •       Name it (e.g., my-first-repo)
        •       Do not check “Initialize with a README”
        •       Click Create Repository

Connect to a remote repo

If you’re pushing this to GitHub:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git


⸻

✅ 2. Stage the file

Tell Git that you want to track this file:

git add README.md

This adds it to the staging area, which is like a prep zone before committing.

⸻

✅ 3. Commit the change

Create your first commit — a snapshot of your project:

git commit -m "Initial commit"



⸻

✅ 4. PUSH this to GitHub

If you’re pushing this to GitHub:

git push -u origin main

#See if you have any untracked files

git status

This will show:
	•	if there are any untracked files (files Git knows about but hasn’t added),
	•	or if everything is already committed (which is probably the case here).
