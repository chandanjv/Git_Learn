üå± 1. Understand the Basics of Git (before GitHub) 

 
 

GitHub is just a host for Git repositories. First, get comfortable with Git itself. 

 
 

Learn: 

What is Git? 

Local vs Remote repositories 

Basic concepts: commit, branch, merge, push, pull, clone 

 
 

Practice: 

git init  

git add .  

git commit -m "Initial commit"  

git remote add origin <repo-url>  

git push -u origin main  

‚úÖ Resource: https://learngitbranching.js.org (super fun visual tool) 

 

 

üåç 2. Learn GitHub Workflow 

 
 

Start understanding how GitHub adds collaboration on top of Git. 

 
 

Key Concepts: 

Repository (repo) 

Pull request (PR): Request to merge code changes 

Fork & Clone: Fork = copy someone else‚Äôs repo to your account; Clone = copy it locally 

Issues: Track bugs/tasks 

Stars and Watch: Like and follow projects 

 
 

Practice: 

Create your own GitHub account 

Create a new repo 

Push a project to GitHub 

Edit a file on GitHub UI 

Try forking a popular repo and cloning it 

 

 

‚öíÔ∏è 3. Use GitHub Daily (on your own projects) 

 
 

The best way to get good is to use it often. 

 
 

Try: 

Creating branches (git checkout -b feature-name) 

Making small commits with clear messages 

Opening pull requests (even for your own work) 

Using .gitignore to avoid uploading unwanted files 

Writing README.md files to explain your project 

 

 

ü§ù 4. Collaborate! 

 
 

Collaboration is where GitHub shines. 

 
 

Practice: 

Contribute to open source (start with documentation or small fixes) 

Work with a friend on the same repo 

Open pull requests, review others‚Äô code, leave comments 

Use GitHub Issues to assign tasks 

 
 

‚úÖ Good-first-contribution repos: 

https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions 

 

 

üß† 5. Level Up 

 
 

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with the basics, explore more: 

git rebase (cleaner commit history) 

git stash (save work temporarily) 

GitHub Actions (automation) 

Branch protection rules 

Squash commits 

 

 

üîÅ 6. Use Git + GitHub in Real Projects 

 
 

This is where the confidence comes. 

Push actual work projects or personal code 

Document everything clearly 

Treat your GitHub like a portfolio 

 

 

Bonus: Use VS Code + GitHub Integration 

 
 

VS Code has built-in Git support. You can push, pull, commit, and manage branches right from the editor ‚Äî very helpful for beginners. 

 

 

If you want, I can: 

Walk you through your first repo setup step by step 

Suggest small projects to try on GitHub 

Review your README or .gitignore 

Teach branching with a mini exercise 

 
 

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to dive in!
