Absolutely! Let’s walk through a real-world scenario where separating git add, git commit, and git push makes perfect sense. 

 

 

🎯  

Scenario: You’re working on a website project 

 
 

You’re building a login page, and you’ve changed a few files: 

- index.html ✅ Updated header - login.html ✅ Added login form - style.css ✅ Styled the login form - README.md ❌ Just testing something, not ready to save  

 
 

 

 

🔍 Step-by-step with Git commands 

 
 

🧮 1.  

git status 

 
 

Check what changed: 

git status  

Output might say: 

Changes not staged for commit: modified: index.html modified: login.html modified: style.css modified: README.md  

You only want to save the HTML and CSS changes — but not README.md. 

 

 

✅ 2.  

git add 

 – stage the files you  

do 

 want to save: 

git add index.html login.html style.css  

Now, only these three are staged for the next commit. 

 
 

📝 README.md stays untracked for now — smart move! 

 

 

📸 3.  

git commit 

 – take a snapshot of your work 

git commit -m "Added login form and styled it"  

Now Git has saved a version of just those 3 files — and you’ve described what changed. 

 
 

But it’s only saved locally, on your machine. 

 

 

🚀 4.  

git push 

 – share your work with the team 

 
 

When you’re confident and ready to share your update: 

git push  

Now your code is on GitHub, and your teammates can see it 🎉 

 

 

💥 What if it was just one command? 

 
 

If Git had only one big “save & upload” command, you would’ve been forced to: 

Save all the changes (including your test in README.md) 

Possibly push broken or incomplete work 

Lose the ability to review or organize your changes
