git init is a Git command used to create a new Git repository in your current directory.

Here’s what happens when you run git init:
	•	It creates a hidden .git folder in the directory.
	•	This .git folder stores all the metadata, configuration, and history for version control.
	•	It tells Git to start tracking changes in the files of that directory.

Use case:

You’re starting a new project and want to use Git to track its history:

mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init

Now my-project is a Git repository, and you can start adding files, staging changes, and making commits.

Let me know if you want a visual or want to practice the flow!
